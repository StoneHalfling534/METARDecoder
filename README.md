# METARDecoder
A METAR is a meteoroligical aerodrome report used by pilots and aviation enthusiasts around the world to gain an accurate reading of the 
weather, including the winds, directions, clouds, visibility, and any special weather conditions including wind shear, tornadoes, dust storms,
etc. The METAR report is generally coded in a series of letters and numbers that can look like gibberish to the untrained eye. However, they 
provide much more information than a general weather report viewed online. Due to this, the METAR decoder was programmed. The decoder is a 
parser coded in java that breaks apart and analyzes METAR reports. The input is an encoded METAR report, with the output being a series of 
weather statements in plain text. More improvements are planned, including adding machine learning and NLP functionality that can use speech 
recognition to have audio inputs, and convert plain text into METAR, and find errors (if any) in the format of the inputted text.
